<p> I am a researcher and algorithm developer at robo advisor start up. I have worked for the first and the largest Robo-Advisor companies in Korea. as we are the only two in charge of developing investment algorithms. Two algorithms among my algorithms get patented. In addition, Two out of my three papers were authored while working. This in many ways helped to consolidate our companyâ€™s position as one of the leading Robo-Advisor companies. Since this algorithm is applied to our cash cow service that enables non-face-to-face trading.</p>

<p> However everything we know now is only the tiny tip of a huge iceberg that the industry and academia are trying to unravel. I want to be one of the pioneers who explores the new portions of the iceberg. </p>

<p>For this, I desperately need the Ph.D. program to make progress on my numerous pressing questions. </p>
