<p>Hello! My name is Jaeyong Lee</p>

<p> A colleague of mine and I developed the Optimal Stock Position Calculator module (“Position-Optimizer”) at a first generation Robo-Advisor company in Korea as we are the only two in charge of developing investment algorithms. In fact, this algorithm is patented in our names, and it is being used actively almost every day by thousands of our clients since 2018.
This in many ways helped to consolidate our company’s position as one of the leading Robo-Advisor companies. Since this algorithm is applied to our cash cow service that enables non-face-to-face trading (especially helpful amidst the pandemic), it is not an overstatement to claim bit of a credit for our stellar growth; from 20 to close to 100 employees.</p>

<p>Everything we know now is only the tiny tip of a huge iceberg that the industry and academia are trying to unravel. I want to be one of the pioneers who explores the new portions of the iceberg. </p>

<p>And for this, I desperately need your program to make progress on my numerous pressing questions. </p>
