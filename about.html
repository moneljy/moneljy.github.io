<p>“Hanjin bankruptcy: S Korea throws lifeline to shipping firm” (BBC, 2017) and “South Korea's STX Offshore Files for US Bankruptcy Protection" (WSJ, 2016)” – when I read news like these, they are very real to me: They are not just news about companies far away somewhere – they were two leading companies in my father’s industry (as my father is a marine broker). Thus, his already tiny company, got swept away by the “tsunami” that hit the marine industry hard – and also his company. And he had to close the business in 2020. </p>

<p>But this was not the first time. In fact, he experienced two major business failures; 1st failure at 49 and the 2nd (harsher) failure at 59 – even when he is an honest, one of the hardest working individuals I know; vacations, we had none. He had worked at his tiny company that meant everything to him day and night, 365x24.</p>

<p class="mb-5">Worse yet, like the Korean saying goes, “Tragedy comes all at once”, the list of the misfortunes we faced as a family was longer; my two grandmothers became ill, while none of the aunts and uncles could afford to help them (or us) as they were barely managing to survive in low-paying jobs such as plumbing and cleaning.</p>

<p>Thus, whereas most of his friends retired comfortably, my father lost all his savings, in fact, he even ended up with a huge debt.  </p>

<p>I can only second guess what my father must have felt. </p>

<p>But he refused to give up. He bounced back right away despite the harsh reality because he had to - for us, to open doors for us that were shut tight in his life; he lost his own father at 13, and his mother, my grandmother, did everything to survive – selling vegetables on the street to feed her five children. Thus, my father had “chosen” a field that would guarantee job right away, that will pay enough. . Even when he was at his lowest, he continued to encourage me to never give up, to dream.  </p>

<p>So, I left. I left my hometown, a small city hundreds of miles away from Seoul to New York (where I interned) and to Illinois (where I was an exchange student at the UIUC). </p>

<p>But I also wanted to help my dear father. Thus, I studied day and night, scoring top 7% on my Korean SAT among all the Korean students nationwide, which was more than sufficient to make it to top school in Seoul, but an option that I crossed out because I needed that full four-year scholarship that my alma mater (a regional school) offered. </p>

<p>To be honest, I was sad, but only for a few days because to me, my absolute priority is my father and my family. Thus, I also worked for a year while juggling school to earn money. This money was not to be used as a nice extra pocket money that I could do without. Instead, I helped my father pay off some of his debt with it and to pay for my own education (my master’s). Moreover, I also started to help my parents financially as soon as I got hired full-time. Knowing very well how they, the two most frugal set of people I know, would refuse to accept my money for they too can second guess how hard I worked for it, I instead replaced their old decades-long electronic goods (TV, refrigerator). These were my ways of saying I love you and thank you. </p>

<p>Today when I look back upon my life, I am left only with gratitude. That is, I am so grateful because of the “inheritance” I received. My parents (my mother also experienced the exact same set of ordeals as they worked together side-by-side), they taught me so much about life, how to live, what to prioritize and what not to. And they “taught” me all these mostly through their own actions as they are doers; they work to solve instead of dwelling on the problems. And we stuck together as a team to overcome – in this respect, my family was my teamwork classroom. </p>

<p>Likewise, sheer grit to overcome, refusing to give up no matter how daunting an obstacle may be – these too I learned. So, I withstood all-nighters every other day for two and a half years as an undergraduate-researcher while juggling school work at the same time. They were all bearable because my parents were my powerful motivations. A particular difficult hurdle was the severe herniated intervertebral disc that required a three hour-long surgery. But I won – by constantly reminding myself to sit up right, by eating right, by working out non-stop but carefully, by never skipping not even one rehabilitation session, rain or shine or storm. And I rested whenever I could all the while learning to work smarter. All these paid off in the end – I could even survive the notoriously tough work hours at a startup. </p>

<p>But more than anything, they taught me what empathy means. Even when they were struggling, they never “waited” to give, to contribute for they too had known pain and disillusionment. I would like to believe that I have this in me as well. When I was in high school, they asked me whether I want to volunteer together with them (this went on for an entire year). Whereas most of the students would have given anything for that one more hour of sleep (as the preparation for the Korean SAT is notoriously hellish), I said yes without a moment’s hesitation, and my parents respected my decision to volunteer for the orphaned children and disabled people. Like parents, like son indeed. As such, volunteering, to me, is a fixture on my scheduler. </p>

<p><strong>As a researcher, I will never forget my unchanging motivation – people like my parents.</strong></p>
